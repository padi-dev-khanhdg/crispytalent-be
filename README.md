## Setting env file

ENV file names will be different in different environments.

At the moment, we have 4 environments:

| Environment | ENV file name          | Usage                                                     |
| :---------- | :--------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------- |
| Development | .env.development.local | For developers's local environment                        |
| Test        | .env.test.local        | For jest test, please do not modify this file             |
| Staging     | .env.staging.local     | For staging server, you have to create this file yourself |
| Production  | env.production.local   | For production server, you have to create this yourself   |

> Note: `ENV file name === ".env.${process.env.NODE_ENV || 'development'}.local"`
